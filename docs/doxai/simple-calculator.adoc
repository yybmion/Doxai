== Overview

The `Simple Calculator Class` is responsible for performing basic arithmetic operations (addition and reset). It maintains an internal value and provides methods to modify and reset it.  This class is designed for simple calculations and can be used as a building block in larger applications.

== Detailed Description

The `Calculator` class encapsulates a single numerical value and offers methods to perform addition and reset that value.  The `add` and `reset` methods modify the internal value and utilize method chaining for concise code. The class is designed for simplicity and ease of use in scenarios requiring basic arithmetic operations.  The design prioritizes readability and maintainability.

== Main Use Cases

[source,javascript]
----
// Simple example code using this class
const calc = new Calculator(5);
calc.add(3).reset(10); // Resets to 10
console.log(calc.value); // Outputs 10
----

== Dependencies

* None

== Key Methods

=== add(num)

[source,javascript]
----
this.value += num;
return this;
----

*Purpose*: Adds the input number `num` to the current value of the calculator.

*Parameters*:

* `num` - {number} The number to be added.  Must be a valid number.

*Return Value*: {Calculator} Returns the `Calculator` instance itself, enabling method chaining.

*Exceptions*:

* None explicitly defined in the code.  However, if `num` is not a number, it may lead to unexpected behavior.

*Usage Example*:

[source,javascript]
----
const result = calc.add(5);
----

=== reset(value = 0)

[source,javascript]
----
this.value = value;
return this;
----

*Purpose*: Resets the calculator's internal value to the provided `value` or to 0 if no value is provided.

*Parameters*:

* `value` - {number} The value to reset the calculator to (default is 0).

*Return Value*: {Calculator} Returns the `Calculator` instance itself, enabling method chaining.

*Exceptions*:

* None explicitly defined in the code. However, if `value` is not a number, it may lead to unexpected behavior.

*Usage Example*:

[source,javascript]
----
calc.reset(10);
----


== Important Notes

* Error handling for non-numeric input is not explicitly implemented in the provided code.  Robust error handling should be added for production use.
* The calculator only supports addition and reset operations; more advanced functionalities would require extending the class.
