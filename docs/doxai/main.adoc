= Documentation Generator Action - Technical Documentation

== Overview

This document provides technical documentation for the `DocumentationGenerator` action, a GitHub Action that automatically generates documentation for merged pull requests (PRs) using an AI client.  The action is triggered by an `issue_comment` event and parses a specific command within the comment to determine the scope and language of the documentation generation.

== Dependencies

* `path`: Node.js core module for working with file paths.
* `@actions/core`: GitHub Actions core library for interacting with the GitHub Actions environment.
* `@actions/github`: GitHub Actions library for interacting with the GitHub API.
* `./github`: Custom module (implementation unclear) for interacting with the GitHub API.  Requires further investigation.
* `./ai-client`: Custom module (implementation unclear) for interacting with an AI service. Requires further investigation.
* `./command-parser`: Custom module (implementation unclear) for parsing commands from user comments. Requires further investigation.
* `./file-filter`: Custom module (implementation unclear) for filtering changed files based on scope. Requires further investigation.
* `./logger`: Custom module (implementation unclear) for logging. Requires further investigation.
* `./docs-prompt`: Custom module (implementation unclear) containing functions `createDocsPrompt` and `createUpdateDocsPrompt`. Requires further investigation.
* `./config`: Custom module (implementation unclear) containing configuration, including `docsPromptTemplates`. Requires further investigation.


== Class: DocumentationGenerator

This class encapsulates the main logic for the documentation generation process.

=== Constructor

`constructor()`: Initializes the logger, command parser, file filter, and sets the GitHub and AI clients to `null`.  These clients are initialized later in the `initializeClients` method.

=== Methods

==== `run()`

The main entry point for the action.  It performs the following steps:

1. Logs the start of the process.
2. Validates the environment and GitHub event.
3. Parses the command from the user comment.
4. Initializes the GitHub and AI clients.
5. Processes the PR to generate documentation.
6. Logs the completion or failure of the process.  Handles errors and attempts to post an error comment.

==== `validateEnvironment()`

Validates that the action is triggered by an `issue_comment` event on a pull request. Returns an object with `isValid` (boolean) and `message` (string) properties.

==== `parseCommand(payload)`

Parses the command from the comment body using the `commandParser`.  Validates the command and posts an error comment if invalid. Returns the parsed command object or `null`.

==== `initializeClients()`

Asynchronously initializes the `githubClient` and `aiClient`. Throws an error if initialization fails.

==== `processPR(payload, command)`

Processes the pull request.  It retrieves PR details, checks if the PR is merged, gets and filters changed files, and processes the documentation generation.

==== `processDocumentation(prDetails, files, command, username)`

Handles the core documentation generation process.  It creates or gets a documentation branch, processes each file, and creates or updates the documentation PR.

==== `processFile(file, prDetails, docsBranch, command, results)`

Processes a single file.  It retrieves file content, generates the documentation path, checks for existing documentation, generates documentation using the AI client, and commits the documentation to the documentation branch.

==== `checkExistingDoc(sourceFile, docFile, docsBranch, prDetails)`

Checks if documentation for a given file already exists in the documentation branch or the base branch. Returns an object indicating existence, content, and whether the source file has changed.

==== `generateDocumentation(filename, content, existingDoc, prDetails, language)`

Generates documentation using the AI client.  Uses different prompts based on whether existing documentation exists. The prompt templates are loaded from the `config` module.

==== `createOrUpdateDocsPR(prDetails, docsBranch, existingPR, results, command, username)`

Creates or updates the documentation PR based on the processing results.  Posts appropriate comments to the source PR.

==== `createDocsPR(prDetails, docsBranch, results, command)`

Creates a new documentation PR.

==== `generatePRBody(prDetails, results, command)`

Generates the markdown body for the documentation PR.

==== `postUpdateComment(prNumber, results, command, username)`

Posts an update comment to an existing documentation PR.

==== `postSummaryComment(prNumber, results, prUrl, existingPR, username)`

Posts a summary comment to the source PR.

==== `postErrorComment(errorMessage)`

Posts an error comment to the source PR.


== Function: main()

The main function that creates an instance of `DocumentationGenerator` and runs the action.

== Module Exports

Exports the `DocumentationGenerator` class and the `main` function.

== Unclear Aspects

Several custom modules (`./github`, `./ai-client`, `./command-parser`, `./file-filter`, `./logger`, `./docs-prompt`, `./config`) lack implementation details.  Their functionality needs to be documented separately to fully understand the action's behavior.  The specific AI service used and the format of the `docsPromptTemplates` also require further clarification.
