== Description

This document describes the `HashTable` class, a JavaScript implementation of a hash table data structure.  The hash table uses a linked list to handle collisions.  The default size of the hash table is 32, but this can be adjusted in the constructor.  The hash function used is a simple sum of character codes; a more sophisticated approach (like polynomial string hash) could be used to reduce collisions.  The implementation includes methods for setting, getting, deleting, checking existence, and retrieving keys and values.  The `LinkedList` class from `../linked-list/LinkedList` is used as a dependency.


== Class: HashTable

=== Constructor

----
`constructor(hashTableSize = defaultHashTableSize)`
----

Creates a new `HashTable` instance.

* `hashTableSize` (number, optional): The size of the hash table. Defaults to `defaultHashTableSize` (32).

=== Methods

==== `hash(key)`

----
`hash(key)`
----

Converts a key string to a hash number using a simple sum of character codes.  A more sophisticated hashing algorithm could be implemented for better collision handling.  This is not explicitly documented.

* `key` (string): The key to hash.
* Returns: (number) The hash number.

==== `set(key, value)`

----
`set(key, value)`
----

Sets a key-value pair in the hash table. If the key already exists, its value is updated.

* `key` (string): The key.
* `value`: The value to associate with the key.

==== `delete(key)`

----
`delete(key)`
----

Deletes a key-value pair from the hash table.

* `key` (string): The key to delete.
* Returns: (*) The deleted value, or `null` if the key was not found.

==== `get(key)`

----
`get(key)`
----

Retrieves the value associated with a key.

* `key` (string): The key.
* Returns: (*) The value associated with the key, or `undefined` if the key is not found.

==== `has(key)`

----
`has(key)`
----

Checks if a key exists in the hash table.

* `key` (string): The key to check.
* Returns: (boolean) `true` if the key exists, `false` otherwise.

==== `getKeys()`

----
`getKeys()`
----

Retrieves an array of all keys in the hash table.

* Returns: (string[]) An array of keys.

==== `getValues()`

----
`getValues()`
----

Retrieves an array of all values in the hash table.

* Returns: (*[]) An array of values.


== Dependencies

* `../linked-list/LinkedList`:  This class is used to manage collisions within the hash table buckets.  The specific implementation details of this class are not provided in this document.

== Notes

* The hash function used is a simple character code sum.  More robust hashing algorithms may be necessary for production environments to minimize collisions.
* The default hash table size is small (32) for demonstration purposes.  Larger sizes generally lead to fewer collisions.
