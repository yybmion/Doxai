= Trie Data Structure in JavaScript

== Overview

This document describes the `Trie` class implemented in JavaScript, located in `examples/javascript/algorithms/trie.js`.  A Trie (pronounced "try") is a tree-like data structure used for efficient retrieval of keys in a set, often used for auto-completion or spell-checking. This implementation uses a `TrieNode` class (assumed to be defined in `./TrieNode.js`; details of this class are not provided and therefore undocumented).  The root node uses the character '*' as its value.

== Class: Trie

=== Constructor: `constructor()`

Creates a new `Trie` instance with a root node initialized with the `HEAD_CHARACTER` ('*').

=== Method: `addWord(word)`

[source,javascript]
----
/**
 * @param {string} word
 * @return {Trie}
 */
addWord(word) {
  // ... implementation ...
}
----

Adds a word to the Trie.  The implementation iterates through the characters of the word, adding each character as a child node to the current node. The last character's `isCompleteWord` flag is set to `true`. Returns the `Trie` instance for method chaining.

=== Method: `deleteWord(word)`

[source,javascript]
----
/**
 * @param {string} word
 * @return {Trie}
 */
deleteWord(word) {
  // ... implementation ...
}
----

Deletes a word from the Trie. Uses a depth-first search approach.  If a node becomes empty (no children) and its `isCompleteWord` flag is `false`, it is removed. Returns the `Trie` instance for method chaining.  The behavior when attempting to delete a non-existent word is unclear from the provided code.

=== Method: `suggestNextCharacters(word)`

[source,javascript]
----
/**
 * @param {string} word
 * @return {string[]}
 */
suggestNextCharacters(word) {
  // ... implementation ...
}
----

Suggests the next possible characters given a prefix (`word`). Returns an array of characters or `null` if the prefix is not found in the Trie.  The exact behavior and return type of the `suggestChildren()` method called within this function is unknown without the `TrieNode` class definition.

=== Method: `doesWordExist(word)`

[source,javascript]
----
/**
 * Check if complete word exists in Trie.
 *
 * @param {string} word
 * @return {boolean}
 */
doesWordExist(word) {
  // ... implementation ...
}
----

Checks if a complete word exists in the Trie. Returns `true` if the word exists, `false` otherwise.

=== Method: `getLastCharacterNode(word)`

[source,javascript]
----
/**
 * @param {string} word
 * @return {TrieNode}
 */
getLastCharacterNode(word) {
  // ... implementation ...
}
----

Finds the TrieNode corresponding to the last character of the given word. Returns the node if found, otherwise returns `null`.

== Dependencies

* `./TrieNode.js`:  This file contains the definition of the `TrieNode` class, which is crucial for the functionality of the `Trie` class.  The details of this class are not provided and therefore its methods (`addChild`, `removeChild`, `getChild`, `hasChild`, `suggestChildren`) are undocumented.

== Assumptions and Unclear Points

* The implementation of the `TrieNode` class is unknown and therefore its methods are not documented.  The behavior of the `Trie` class depends heavily on the `TrieNode` class.
* The behavior of `deleteWord` when attempting to delete a non-existent word is unclear.
* The return type and exact behavior of `suggestChildren()` method of `TrieNode` class is unknown.
