= Queue Implementation in JavaScript

== Overview

This document describes the `Queue` class implemented in JavaScript, utilizing a linked list for its underlying structure.  The `Queue` class provides standard queue operations: enqueue (add to the rear), dequeue (remove from the front), peek (view the front element), and isEmpty (check for emptiness).  It leverages a `LinkedList` class (assumed to be defined elsewhere and correctly implemented).

== Class: Queue

The `Queue` class is implemented using a `LinkedList` as its internal storage. This choice is based on the similarity between queue operations (enqueue/dequeue) and linked list operations (append/deleteHead).

=== Dependencies

* `LinkedList`:  Assumed to be a correctly implemented linked list class.  The specific implementation details are not provided in this file and are considered external dependencies.  The functionality of `append`, `deleteHead`, and `toString` methods from the `LinkedList` class are assumed.

=== Methods

==== `constructor()`

Creates a new `Queue` instance, initializing an internal `LinkedList` object.

==== `isEmpty()`

Returns `true` if the queue is empty, `false` otherwise.

==== `peek()`

Returns the value of the element at the front of the queue without removing it. Returns `null` if the queue is empty.

==== `enqueue(value)`

Adds a new element with the given `value` to the rear of the queue.

==== `dequeue()`

Removes and returns the value of the element at the front of the queue. Returns `null` if the queue is empty.

==== `toString(callback)`

Returns a string representation of the queue.  The exact format of the string is dependent on the `toString` method of the underlying `LinkedList` class and any provided `callback` function. The purpose and behavior of the optional `callback` parameter is unclear without further information on the `LinkedList.toString` method.


== Assumptions

* The `LinkedList` class is correctly implemented and provides the methods `append`, `deleteHead`, and `toString` with the expected behavior.
* The behavior of the optional `callback` parameter in the `toString` method is not specified and requires further clarification.

== Example Usage (Illustrative)

```javascript
import Queue from './queue';

const queue = new Queue();
queue.enqueue(10);
queue.enqueue(20);
console.log(queue.peek()); // Output: 10
console.log(queue.dequeue()); // Output: 10
console.log(queue.isEmpty()); // Output: false
console.log(queue.toString()); // Output:  Depends on LinkedList.toString() implementation
```
```
