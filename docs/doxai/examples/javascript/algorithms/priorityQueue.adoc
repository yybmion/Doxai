= PriorityQueue Class

== PR Information

* PR Number: 33
* Author: yybmion
* Created Date: 2025-05-27
* Last Modified: 2025-05-27 by yybmion

== File Information

* Filename: examples/javascript/algorithms/priorityQueue.js
* Language: JavaScript

== Description

This JavaScript class `PriorityQueue` implements a priority queue data structure based on a min heap.  It extends the `MinHeap` class and uses a `Comparator` for comparing elements based on their priority.  The priority of each item is stored in a separate `Map`.  The exact implementation details of `MinHeap` and `Comparator` are assumed to be defined elsewhere and are not fully documented here.

== Dependencies

* `MinHeap`:  An assumed class providing min-heap functionality.  The specific implementation is unknown.
* `Comparator`: An assumed class providing comparison functionality. The specific implementation is unknown.

== Class Methods

=== Constructor

`constructor()`

Initializes a new `PriorityQueue` instance. Calls the `MinHeap` constructor, initializes a `priorities` map to store item priorities, and sets up a custom comparator (`compare`) that uses the `comparePriority` method.

=== `add(item, priority = 0)`

Adds an item to the priority queue with an optional priority. If no priority is provided, it defaults to 0.  Updates the `priorities` map and adds the item to the heap using the `super.add()` method.

* `item`: The item to add.  Type is unknown.
* `priority`: The priority of the item (number). Defaults to 0.
* Returns: The `PriorityQueue` instance.

=== `remove(item, customFindingComparator)`

Removes an item from the priority queue.  Removes the item from the heap using `super.remove()` and updates the `priorities` map.  The exact behavior of `customFindingComparator` is unclear without further documentation on the `super.remove()` method.

* `item`: The item to remove. Type is unknown.
* `customFindingComparator`: (Optional) A custom comparator for finding the item to remove.  Functionality is unclear without further context.
* Returns: The `PriorityQueue` instance.

=== `changePriority(item, priority)`

Changes the priority of an existing item in the queue.  It removes the item using a comparator that compares values (`compareValue`), then adds it back with the new priority.

* `item`: The item to re-prioritize. Type is unknown.
* `priority`: The new priority of the item (number).
* Returns: The `PriorityQueue` instance.

=== `findByValue(item)`

Finds an item in the queue based on its value. The return type and behavior are unclear without further context on the underlying `find` method.

* `item`: The item to find. Type is unknown.
* Returns:  `Number[]`.  The meaning of this return type is unclear.

=== `hasValue(item)`

Checks if an item exists in the queue based on its value.

* `item`: The item to check. Type is unknown.
* Returns: `boolean` - `true` if the item exists, `false` otherwise.

=== `comparePriority(a, b)`

Compares the priorities of two items using the `priorities` map.

* `a`: The first item. Type is unknown.
* `b`: The second item. Type is unknown.
* Returns: `number` - -1 if `a` has lower priority, 1 if `a` has higher priority, 0 if priorities are equal.

=== `compareValue(a, b)`

Compares the values of two items.

* `a`: The first item. Type is unknown.
* `b`: The second item. Type is unknown.
* Returns: `number` - -1 if `a` is less than `b`, 1 if `a` is greater than `b`, 0 if `a` and `b` are equal.


== Notes

The code relies heavily on the `MinHeap` and `Comparator` classes, whose implementations are not provided.  The exact behavior of some methods (`findByValue`, `remove`, `find`) is unclear without further documentation of these dependent classes.  The type of items stored in the priority queue is also not specified.
