== Overview

The `UserManager` class provides a simple mechanism for managing user accounts.  It utilizes a `Map` to store user data, offering methods for adding, retrieving, updating, removing, and querying users based on their ID and role.  The class does not handle persistence; user data is lost when the application terminates.

== Class: UserManager

=== Constructor: `constructor()`

Creates a new `UserManager` instance. Initializes an internal `Map` called `users` to store user data.  No parameters are required.

=== Method: `addUser(id, userData)`

Adds a new user to the system.

* **Parameters:**
    * `id` (string): A unique identifier for the user.
    * `userData` (object): An object containing user information.  Requires `name` (string) and `email` (string) properties.  Optionally includes `role` (string, defaults to 'user').
* **Returns:** (boolean) `true` if the user was added successfully, `false` if a user with the given ID already exists.
* **Throws:**  No exceptions are explicitly thrown, but behavior is undefined if `id` or required fields in `userData` are invalid.

=== Method: `getUser(id)`

Retrieves a user by their ID.

* **Parameters:**
    * `id` (string): The user ID to look up.
* **Returns:** (object|null) The user object if found, `null` otherwise.

=== Method: `updateUser(id, updatedData)`

Updates an existing user's information.

* **Parameters:**
    * `id` (string): The user ID to update.
    * `updatedData` (object): An object containing the data to update.
* **Returns:** (boolean) `true` if the user was updated successfully, `false` if the user does not exist.
* **Throws:** No exceptions are explicitly thrown.  Behavior is undefined if `id` is invalid.

=== Method: `removeUser(id)`

Removes a user from the system.

* **Parameters:**
    * `id` (string): The user ID to remove.
* **Returns:** (boolean) `true` if the user was removed successfully, `false` if the user does not exist.

=== Method: `recordLogin(id)`

Records a user login event. Updates the `lastLogin` property of the user object.

* **Parameters:**
    * `id` (string): The user ID.
* **Returns:** (boolean) `true` if the login was recorded, `false` if the user does not exist.

=== Method: `getUsersByRole(role)`

Gets all users with a specific role.

* **Parameters:**
    * `role` (string): The role to filter by.
* **Returns:** (array) An array of user objects with the specified role.


== Dependencies

The `UserManager` class has no external dependencies beyond the built-in JavaScript `Map` object.

== Assumptions and Unclear Points

There are no explicit error handling mechanisms (e.g., try-catch blocks) for invalid input. The behavior of the methods with invalid input is undefined and should be clarified.  The internal data structure is a simple in-memory `Map`; no persistence mechanism is implemented.
